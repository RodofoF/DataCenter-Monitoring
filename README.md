# DataCenter-Monitoring

## Objecive
The objective of this projective is to help developers how to monitoring your workplace, i.e DataCenter, laboratory, factory or where you can adapt this project.

## Description
To monitoring your workplace I am using NodeMCU board. The great advantage of this component is that you can programming as arduino boards, but it is already includes wi-fi module.
On the internet you can find a lots of content to develop your project and improve.

## Next steps
At the moment each sensor are monitoring individualy and without storage information.
* Develop ways to webscrapping the webservers and insert information from arduino on Zabbix.
* Develop a webpage where I can see NodeMCU information
* Now, the NodeMCU boards are generation web pages the ideal is generate APIs as stantard

## Note
I will try give recognition to all fonts that helped me on the reference
